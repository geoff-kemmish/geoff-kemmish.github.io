    <p>Back in the days when dinosaurs - or at least 18-wheelers with “ Prime Computer “ and “ Digital “ painted on their sides - roamed Route 128 and the Mass Pike, there were attempts to create reliable systems from unreliable components. But minicomputers were too expensive to survive when the PC revolution arrived, and fault-tolerant minicomputers were REALLY expensive.</p>

<p>Whatever approach the system architects adopted, the idea was to deliver something like 99.999% reliability. Which sounds impressive until you realize that this allows five minutes failure in a year - and if those five minutes coincided with the first five minutes of equity trading on an important day, then the fur would fly regardless.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few decades.</p>

<p>Hopefully your Data Governance Committee/Board will accept that a quality target of 100% accuracy is out of reach. Offer them a target of 99.999% and the meeting will probably move on happily to the next agenda item.</p>

<p>In our world of Big Data that is just not good enough - if your processing uses 100,000,000 data points a day, 99.999% accuracy means 1,000 errors. Even with your Data Quality team working at full speed 24 hours a day, they would need to find and fix one error every minute to clean them up.</p>

<p>And while your annual goals might well include a quality target, when things go wrong that isn’t how you’ll be judged. What will actually count is the effect of an error on the overall result : perhaps a cash flow item with the wrong sign in a quarterly financial report’s data causes you to buy into the shares of a company that declares bankruptcy later that same day. But if the error didn’t change your day’s trading, the existence of that error wouldn’t have mattered even if it had been noticed.</p>

<p>Catching those problems ahead of time is almost impossible unless you can afford a Space Shuttle-like investment in multiple implementations of the same system. Otherwise, you will have to attack the problem from two directions at the same time  :</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Understand the data well enough so that you can construct heuristics to find suspicious values in the raw data before it’s used ( for a company that files its results every quarter, that cash flow value should be unchanged for 89 days in a row, so a change at any other time is automatically suspicious ), and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand your process well enough so that you can construct heuristics to recognize “ unlikely “ data values after they are calculated but before they are used .</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Whatever happens, data errors will always be with you. And the post-mortems will always include the question “ why didn’t you catch it in time ? “</p>

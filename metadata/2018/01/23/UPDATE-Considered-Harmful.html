    <p>In 1968, Prof. Dijkstra submitted a letter to the “ Communications of the ACM “ which he titled “ A case against the GOTO statement “. A subeditor - clearly destined for greater things - rebranded it “ GOTO Considered Harmful “ and that phrase, quoted and misquoted many times over nearly half a century, has been with us ever since.</p>

<p>It was born in a time when you were expected to prove rigorously that your code would work correctly under all conditions - my initiation to that world was to design and implement a long-division procedure for hardware which supported only integer division. Prof. Dijkstra’s insight was that once you had introduced GOTOs and their corresponding targets into your code, it became exponentially harder to determine the path that program execution might have taken in order to arrive at one of those targets: to determine the history by which a particular program state had been reached.</p>

<p>For most of the intervening half-century database servers have offered us a destructive UPDATE command - to allow us to specify a new value in a database to replace an old one. This, of course, poses exactly the same problem. It does not support the ability to ask the database server how the state of a particular record evolved over time.</p>

<p>Following their tradition of shipping minimally acceptable products, the database vendors allowed us to see the commands that had operated on a record by interpreting the transaction log - so long as we hadn’t truncated it to save space and keep the database running. Eventually, facilities like SQL Server’s CDC emerged that simplify things greatly - but even so, provide none of the metadata surrounding an update that would be needed for the database to properly distinguish, for example, whether a new value was truly a new value, a revision, or a correction for a mistaken observation of an unchanged value.</p>

<p>The metadata for database changes should reside in the database itself - otherwise it will suffer from the same kind of digital rot as documentation. Even better, the history of a value in a record - metadata and all - should live in the same table as the current value. Rather than holding just an “ int “ value for each record, the table should hold a stack of “ int “ values and their metadata - when was the value entered, by whom, why and so forth.</p>

<p>Why is this important ?</p>

<p>Because Disruption.</p>

<p>In a competitive business environment, you as a “ data guy “ have no idea where the next challenge to your company’s existing business is going to come from, or the one after that, or the one after that… In that case you had better make sure that you are keeping every scrap of information that you can.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you’re not working with a database at all, but an application-specific data store - it meets the business’ current needs, but at any moment, with a day or less notice, you’ll have to tear it up, start over and spend a huge amount of effort reconstituting data from spreadsheets or worse. And, it could be argued, you are not fulfilling your fiduciary duty to your employers and their clients.</p>

<p>My thoughts on the DELETE command are left as an exercise for the reader…</p>

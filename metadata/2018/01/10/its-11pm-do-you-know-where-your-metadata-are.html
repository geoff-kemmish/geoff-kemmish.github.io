    <p>Look at your databases. What data types do they store ? Most likely <em>int</em>, <em>date-time</em>, <em>char</em> and so on.</p>

<p>Now reread the Business Requirements those databases were built to satisfy. What data values were to be stored ? Prices, quantities, names, addresses and so on.</p>

<p>Where is the specification of how (for example) Order Quantity should be stored as a <em>smallint</em> ? That specification is the metadata - and just as software documentation was a serious problem for more than 50 years until the Jupyter Notebooks and their like showed up, where and how to store metadata has been and continues to be a serious problem.</p>

<p>For a numeric value, a complete set of metadata might look something like :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unit</li>
  <li>Scale</li>
  <li>Definition</li>
  <li>Date/time range for which the stored value is valid</li>
  <li>Function to derive the stored value from the actual values during that date/time range ( last, mean and so on)</li>
  <li>Date/time when the current value was stored</li>
  <li>Date/time when this value was superseded</li>
  <li>Lineage ( where do the values normally come from and how )</li>
  <li>Person responsible ( the data “steward” )</li>
  <li>If this value replaces another :
    <ul>
      <li>Reason why this value supersedes the earlier one</li>
      <li>Who proposed the new value and when</li>
      <li>Who approved the new value and when</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For a non-numeric value, the Unit and Scale values could be skipped: but otherwise, for a database that might be audited, inspected by a regulator, or even subject to a senior management query like “ why the %#% did we sell those widgets at that price ? “ any of those metadata items might be needed at any time.</p>

<p>So where and how do you store all of that extra information ? - after all our single integer value now comes with a “ tail “ of two integers, five lookup codes, six date/time values and a couple of long character strings. Perhaps one or more of :</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the original specification documents. Shame on you.</li>
  <li>In a central, update-able library ( like a wiki ). At least this way there’s a chance that the metadata will be kept up to date: the chance is higher the more aggressively your documentation policies are policed. And eventually you might even find yourselves with a company-wide data dictionary.</li>
  <li>In the database along with the original value. There would of course be much complaining about “ speed “ and “ space “, but so long as the data value and its metadata live in the same database we have the opportunity to make sure that values and their documentation are kept in sync.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s no simple one-size-fits-all answer. From what I’ve seen over the years, there’s been precious little effort made to ensure that data fields and values are properly documented at all. But without that effort, there will always be surprises - like the fire drill when a Price that is expected to be expressed in USD, arrives in Roubles - and those surprises will require an immediate response, not a years-long review of data quality.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, the first computing acronym I learned was GIGO - “ Garbage in, garbage out “. It’s as true now as it ever was. No matter how clever your algorithm, how modern your language, how fancy your tools, if your code is given unexpected data it will give unexpected results. Writing that code is - or should be - a one-off exercise, maintaining the data it needs to work properly is a shift-by-shift, day-by-day grind that for too long has been pushed into the background by IT departments chasing after new toys.</p>

<p>What is needed is not new data management tools - there are lots around and there will be even more to choose from in the future - but management commitment to support the never-ending effort required to deliver “ clean “ data and an understanding that the people tasked with that job are in today’s world among the most important ones in the Firm, but that they can only do that job if the data is properly documented.</p>

<p>Two points</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Call me a pedant but <em>data</em> is a plural noun, the singular form is <em>datum</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who watched the evening news in New York in the late 1980’s will recognize the title</p>
  </li>
</ul>

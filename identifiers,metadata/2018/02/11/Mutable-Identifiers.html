    <p>However your data is stored - in directories of VSAM files, behind SQL or NoSQL servers, in key-value stores or wherever - there is one constant. Each real-world entity that is being modeled will need a unique, immutable identifier.</p>

<p>If you’re looking at a database of people and have access to their Social Security numbers, you’re in luck - they change only in extreme circumstances, when entering a witness protection program for example. Unless that matters to you - unless you are the FBI or the State Department - you can probably ignore the possibility of an SSN changing. Of course, you cannot ignore the possibility that it was transcribed into your database incorrectly and had to be corrected.</p>

<p>Other cases are not so simple. When Google announced a corporate reorganization under which their issued shares would morph “ transparently “ into shares of a new company, Alphabet, they added that those shares’ exchange tickers would not change. Day- and high frequency-traders would indeed not be affected if all their systems used were market prices.</p>

<p>Trading might not be affected, but settlement would. CUSIP and ISIN numbers have been allocated alphabetically based on the issuing company’s name since the 1920s. ‘ Alphabet ‘ and ‘ Google ‘ are quite far apart in any lexical ordering, so settlement systems and databases would need to be able to link the old and new numbers together.</p>

<p>Financial results are filed with the SEC by legal entity - ‘ Alphabet ‘ is a different filing entity than ‘ Google’ and so its ( future ) financial reports would be filed under a different CIK code than ( past ) filings. Any systems or databases that attempt to link market prices with financial filings would need to cope with the situation where one of the relevant identifiers has changed and the other hasn’t.</p>

<p>Luckily, within the M&amp;A domain, this is not a complex transaction. The underlying business has not changed. The last reported revenue figure for ‘ Google ‘ will be directly comparable with the first reported value for ‘ Alphabet ‘. Where large chunks of a company are spun off or acquired, there will not just be identifier changes, but also the need for adjustments to reported figures to try to make them comparable.</p>

<p>In truth, once you accept that ‘ Everything is a Time-series ‘ these problems are inevitable. Whichever attribute of a real-world entity you choose to act as its Identifier will - or can be expected to - change over time.</p>

<p>Naïve solutionism says that if the real world can’t give you an immutable identifier, make up one of your own. But that introduces a whole new level of complexity. Your data is now in two parts : a “ Heap O’ Data “ where real-world data values are tagged with your internal identifier and a set of maps between your internal identifiers and the attributes that you would have used as identifiers, if only they had behaved properly.</p>

<p>As always, there is no one-size-fits-all correct solution. But however you design your database and the systems that depend on it, you will need to have considered all the possible combinations of changes in identifiers for the data items that are being used - in the case of the ‘ Google ‘ to ‘ Alphabet ‘ change there could be as many as 16. If your data team don’t have documentation to consult when an unusual combination turns up, Murphy’s Law says that they will have no time for planning or discussion before someone starts screaming about lost revenue and profit.</p>
